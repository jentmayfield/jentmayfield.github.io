<section>"Hello, my name is Jennifer Mayfield I'm originally from Greeley, Colorado. I grew up as an Army brat and lived all over
the place throughout my childhood. One of my father's last duty stations was at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. 
I spent my last two years of High School and College in Las Cruces, NM. This was also where my grandmother was originally from. 
My first job out of High School was a night auditor at the Las Cruces Hilton where I discovered my aptitude for numbers and pursued.
Accounting. I had my first job as an auditor in Los Angeles, CA and worked on my MS in Accountancy from the University of Notre Dame.</section>

I eventually settled in Austin, Texas and earned my CPA license in Texas. I'm currently an Assistant Controller for a nonprofit that helps the community 
find affordable housing. I enjoy volunteering in scouting as a Bear den leader for third graders. We host an exchange student from Japan. I also volunteering
as a volunteer deputy registrar in Travis County. I enjoy spending time traveling with my husband, my two sons and step-daughter."

    <!--In a new HTML file, create the basic structure of an HTML document and include in it the following:
1. `DOCTYPE` declaration
2. `head` tag with nested `title` tag
3. `h1` tag with a title of your choice
4. Embed an image
5. Create the following three links on your page:
   1. One link that leads to the website of your choice. Give this link an attribute `target="_blank"` so that it opens a new tab when clicked.
   2. Create a second link to a different website, but give this link bold text.
   3. Make the third link a placeholder so it goes nowhere.
HINT: You should be checking the rendered HTML in Chrome as you code to make sure you're going in the right direction.
### Bonus
* Create an ordered list of steps to make a sandwich.
* Create an unordered list of 5 bands/musicians you like.
* Use an alternate way of separating links without line breaks.
* Embed a YouTube video of your favorite band/musician.  -->

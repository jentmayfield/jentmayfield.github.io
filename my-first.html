    <!--In a new HTML file, create the basic structure of an HTML document and include in it the following:
1. `DOCTYPE` declaration
2. `head` tag with nested `title` tag
3. `h1` tag with a title of your choice
4. Embed an image
5. Create the following three links on your page:
   1. One link that leads to the website of your choice. Give this link an attribute `target="_blank"` so that it opens a new tab when clicked.
   2. Create a second link to a different website, but give this link bold text.
   3. Make the third link a placeholder so it goes nowhere.
HINT: You should be checking the rendered HTML in Chrome as you code to make sure you're going in the right direction.
### Bonus
* Create an ordered list of steps to make a sandwich.
* Create an unordered list of 5 bands/musicians you like.
* Use an alternate way of separating links without line breaks.
* Embed a YouTube video of your favorite band/musician.  -->
